## Hi there, I'm Quentin! 👋

I embarked on my coding journey just two years ago, making me a junior developer eager to learn and grow.

🛠️ **Tech Environments:**
- Former Ubuntu and Debian user, I explored Manjaro but prefer Debian-based systems.
- No hands-on experience with MacOS, and I prefer steering clear of Windows for coding.
- Proficient in VSCode for regular development, however, for potential security reasons, I am also comfortable using Vim.

💻 **Technical Experience:**
- **C:** One year of hands-on experience with diverse projects.
- **C++** Another year of experiences with other diverse projects.
- **Web Development:** Six months of dedicated work with React.js.
- **Versatility:** I've also dabbled in various other languages, contributing to light projects.
- **Current Focus:** Currently working on advanced projects.

🌱 **Constantly Learning:**
- Eager to expand my knowledge and tackle new challenges.
- Actively working on honing my coding skills and exploring new technologies.
